Several solutions exist to resolve this issue. One approach involves using the `:not(:hover)` pseudo-class in conjunction with the parent element's selector:

```css
.container:not(:hover) a:hover {
  color: darkblue; /* Style for the link when hovering, if no parent hover */
}

.container:hover {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

.container a {
  color: blue;
}
.container:hover a {
  color: darkblue; /* Style for the link when parent is hovering */
}
```

This approach ensures that the parent's hover style applies independently of the child element's hover.  Alternatively, you can use JavaScript to manage the hover behavior or utilize CSS variables to create a more sophisticated styling system that avoids potential conflicts.
