The following CSS code snippet exhibits unexpected behavior in some browsers.  The `:hover` pseudo-class on the `.container` element doesn't apply correctly when the mouse hovers over the nested `<a>` element:

```css
.container {
  background-color: lightgray;
}

.container:hover {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

.container a {
  color: blue;
}
```
